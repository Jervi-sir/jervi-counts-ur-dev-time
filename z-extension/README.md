# Jervi Counts Your Dev Time ⏳

> “I count ur dev time, so we see who codes more than me.” — Jervi

**Jervi Counts Your Dev Time** is a VS Code extension that automatically tracks your active coding time and syncs it to a global leaderboard.  
No manual timers. No buttons. Just code — and let the numbers speak.

## ⏱️ What Counts as “Dev Time”?

The extension tracks **active coding time**, meaning:
- You are actively interacting with VS Code
- Editing files, navigating code, or working in the editor
- Idle time is automatically ignored

It’s designed to reflect *real* development effort — not just open editor time.

## 🔐 Privacy & Data

- Authentication is handled via **GitHub OAuth**
- Only minimal data is stored:
  - User identifier
  - Aggregated coding time
- No code, files, or keystrokes are ever uploaded

This project tracks *time*, not *content*.

## 🧪 Supported Editors

> *Who actually codes more?*
